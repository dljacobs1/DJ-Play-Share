# DJ-Play-Share
Shared cat repository for practice.
This repository is created to allow users to practice creating branches, make changes to the new branch, save those changes as "commits" and practice pull requests. Following pull requests, the user can merge their branch into the main branch. The only request is that when a user creates a branch, they make sure that branch has something to do with CATS!
